# FunctionalProgrammingExercises
Exercises for the course named "Fundamentals of Functional Programming"

This training is aimed at developers who want to learn about functional programming Scala to improve their coding skills. The session is targeted to an audience that has minimal or zero Scala experience. Ideally the developer has some knowledge of programming in Java, although this is not strictly required.
